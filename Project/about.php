    <p> <b>I</b>ndia is the second largest fresh vegetable producer in the world, with growing economy and urbanization, demand for fresh vegetables has increased    exponentially but in this hectic lifestyle trying to find quality vegetables and fresh produce which are pure and not treated with any preservatives and fertilizers is a difficult job.</p>
 <p>Currently the only places from where you can get vegetable is from small vendors in your locality or from big grocery chains, if you want products at good price you go for small vendors but you cannot be sure about the quality, to get the best you need to go there physically, if you go for big stores, you are getting a branded and quality checked produce but their rates are absurdly high and to keep their vegetables fresh for longer they are often treated with preservatives and other chemicals which are not good for the human body. <p>
